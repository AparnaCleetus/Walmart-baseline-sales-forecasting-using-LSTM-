Walmart baseline sales forecasting using LSTM 
How to run the source code:
1. The Walmart baseline sales forecasting dataset has been derived from four files, stores.csv,features.csv,train.csv and test.csv. 
All these files have been attached. Once these files are saved in your disk replace the path variable in line 21 of the source code with your local path.
2. Once this has been modified save the source file lstm_final and run it.
3. The source file takes the number of epoch for training the model as input.
4. When prompted input the epoch (e) where e>0.
5. The output will be the loss for each epoch of the training data.
6. And then we get the loss for the test data along with the predicted and observed sales that has been normalised.
